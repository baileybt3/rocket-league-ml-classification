# Rocket League Match Outcome Prediction ⚽🤖

This project applies **machine learning classification** to predict the outcomes of **Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS)** matches. Using real-world competitive match data, we train and evaluate models that classify whether a team will win or lose based on match statistics and engineered features.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to:
- Explore competitive **Rocket League esports data** (2022–2024 seasons).  
- Train supervised ML models using Logistic Regression to classify match outcomes.  
- Evaluate model performance across multiple seasons to test **generalization**.  
- Provide insights into which features most influence Rocket League match results.  

This project was developed as part of my **Machine Learning coursework at UNC Charlotte (ITSC 3156)**, but is structured for continued experimentation and portfolio demonstration.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Pipeline

1. **Problem Formulation**  
   - Binary classification: Predict whether **Team A wins** (1) or **loses** (0).

2. **Data Collection**  
   - RLCS match data from 2022–2024.  
   - Includes features such as goals, shots, saves, assists, possession stats, and boost usage.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning & handling missing values.  
   - Normalization/scaling.  
   - Feature engineering & selection.  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression (baseline).   

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score 
   - Validation on 2023 dataset, testing on unseen 2024 dataset.
